# nand2tetris-OS
My (messy) implementation of the Jack OS.

If you read this you already know what all of these classes are supposed to do and if you don't you can probably figure it out by their names.
Just dont look too closely at Screen.jack, the code there just got messy and copy-pasty on its own.
